## Features

### Cross-Category Video Content üìº
The APIs search function supports multi-format queries, allowing users to find movies, TV shows, music videos, and specials in a single request. This enables seamless discovery across different content categories, including mainstream and anime.

Additionally, the API provides a trending content query, allowing users to retrieve popular video content filtered by format and category. This helps users stay updated on what‚Äôs currently trending across different media types.

### Manage and Track Personal Watchlist üìÉ
The API enables users to manage their personal watchlist efficiently. Users can track their watch status (Planned, Watching, Completed, Paused, etc.), monitor the number of watched episodes, and assign personal ratings to each entry. This feature helps users stay organized and keep track of their viewing progress across different types of content.

### "What To Watch" ü§î
For authenticated users with an established watchlist, this functionality assists in deciding what to watch next. Rather than using an informal **jar method** _(a casual term implying the random drawing of a movie title from a hat)_ the system leverages a random selection process. It filters the user‚Äôs watchlist based on their specific preferences (such as category, format, etc.) and then randomly selects a video content item that meets those criteria. This approach provides a spontaneous yet personalized recommendation experience.
